Hi there! This is Yuhui Chen.

I am a second-year D.Phil. student in Control Theory and Enngineering at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/)) advised by Dongbin Zhao. Before joining CASIA, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Information Engineering at Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)) and Electrical Communication Engineering at Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)).
