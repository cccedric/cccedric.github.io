Hi there! This is Yuhui Chen.

I am currently a third-year Phd student in Control Theory and Engineering at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/)), supervised by Professor Dongbin Zhao.

My long-term goal is help building foundation models for embodied AI agent and use that to accelerate research in other fields. My research interests lie in offline reinforcement learning, reward engineering and robot learning, with a focus on sequence models and generative models in order to develop autonomous agents that are capable of understanding the open world, learning from previous behaviors, and interacting intelligently with humans.

Prior to joining CASIA, I was a MCU embedded engineer at Dajiang Innovations ([DJI](https://www.dji.com/)). Before that, I earned my B.Eng. degree in Information Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)) and in Electrical Communication Engineering from Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)).
