I used to think colors were just colors. That is, some looked nice together, some didn’t. That was before someone special taught me otherwise. She had a way of seeing the world that I never did. To her, colors weren’t just visual elements; they told stories, carried emotions, and shaped the way we felt without us even realizing it.

She showed me how different shades complement each other, how a subtle shift in tone can change an entire mood, and how design is more than just rules. it’s about feeling. I didn’t just learn about colors from her, but I learned to appreciate beauty in a way I never had before.

This space is my way of recording what I’ve learned, a reminder of the lessons she left me with. And maybe, in some way, it’s also a way of holding onto something that still lingers in my mind.
