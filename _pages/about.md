Hi there! This is Yuhui Chen.

I am currently a second-year D.Phil. student in Control Theory and Engineering at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/)), under the mentorship of Professor Dongbin Zhao. Prior to joining CASIA, I earned my B.Eng. degree in Information Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)) and in Electrical Communication Engineering from Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)).

My research focuses on developing intelligent machines by enhancing offline reinforcement learning for higher sampling efficiency and faster inference, alongside advancing robot control to improve long-horizon reasoning abilities in the physical world.
